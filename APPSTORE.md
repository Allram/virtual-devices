# Virtual Devices

This app gives you the opportunity to add Virtual Devices to Homey that can be operated from the UI Interface and that can trigger flows.

## What works:

* Simple on/off switch
* Trigger a flow

## What doesn't:

* Only 1 device can be added
* Use the switches status as a condition
* Other devices, like a push-button, Dimmer, etc.

I'm very interested to hear your ideas for other virtual devices. 

## If you like this app

but no sweat if you don't.
