# Virtual Devices

This app gives you the opportunity to add Virtual Devices to Homey that can be operated from the UI Interface and that can trigger flows.

Or you can add a mode and add it as a condition, e.g. to dissable multiple flows when going on Holiday. 

## What works:

* Devices:
  * Switch
  * Alarm
  * Blinds
  * Hifi
  * Light
  * Security
  * TV
* Modes
  * Holiday
  * Away
  * Party
  * Event
  * Quiet
  * Movie
  * Sleep
  * Relax
  * Manual
  

* Trigger a flow
* Use the switch' status as a condition
* Use the switch in the 'then'-column

## What doesn't:

* Blinds can go on/off, not yet up, stop, down
* Other devices, like a Dimmer, etc.

I'm very interested to hear your ideas for other virtual devices.

but no sweat if you don't.
