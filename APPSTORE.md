# Virtual Devices

This app gives you the opportunity to add Virtual Devices to Homey. You can operate the Virtual Devices from the UI and/or use them in flows.

Or you can add a mode and add it as a condition, e.g. to disable multiple flows when going on Holiday. 

## What works:

* Virtual Devices: Switch, Alarm, Blinds, Hifi, Light, Security, TV
* Modes: Holiday, Away, Party, Event, Quiet, Movie, Sleep, Relax, Manual
* Trigger a flow
* Use the status as a condition
* Use the virtual device in the 'then'-column

## What doesn't:

* Other devices, like a Dimmer, etc.
* Settings that disable cascading flows (issue #5)
* Settings (or other) that makes some modes mutually exclusive (issue #3)

I'm very interested to hear your ideas for other virtual devices. 

## If you like this app

If you like this app, you can buy me a (virtual) beer, but no sweat if you don't.
