# Virtual Devices

This app gives you the opportunity to add Virtual Devices to Homey that can be operated from the UI Interface and that can trigger flows.

## What works:

* Simple on/off switch
* Trigger a flow

## What doesn't:

* Use the switches status as a condition
* Other devices, like a push-button, Dimmer, Thermostat, etc.

Requests are possible, but I do not give guarantees on functionality or timelines.
