# Virtual Devices

This app gives you the opportunity to add Virtual Devices to Homey that can be operated from the UI Interface and that can trigger flows.

Or you can add a 'master' switch and add it as a condition, e.g. to dissable multiple flows when going on Holiday. 

## What works:

* Simple on/off switch
* Trigger a flow
* Use the switch' status as a condition
* Use the switch in the 'then'-column

## What doesn't:

* Other devices, like a push-button, Dimmer, etc.

I'm very interested to hear your ideas for other virtual devices.
